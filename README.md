# Excel-project-on-Road-Accident.
I recently got the chance to explore the fascinating Accident dataset in the context of data-driven decision-making. The objective of this study was to get significant insights from the data in order to illuminate different aspects of post-accident scenarios. Permit me to present some of the main conclusions and analysis along with an overview of the project.


KPI’S :
1. Total Casualties Post-Accident:
This is a basic statistic that gives a thorough picture of the total effect of accidents in the dataset.

2. Casualties by Accident Severity and Vehicle Type:
I went further and looked at how casualties were distributed according to the severity of the accident, giving me a more complex picture of the many effects. An additional unique viewpoint to the data was provided by determining the vehicle types linked to the highest number of casualties.


Secondary KPIs:

1. Casualties Categorized by Vehicle Type:
This segmentation makes it possible to target interventions by providing insights into the particular vehicles that are contributing to the overall number of casualties.
2. Monthly Trends in Casualties:
The investigation revealed temporal patterns by comparing monthly casualty numbers for the present and past years, allowing for a proactive approach to accident prevention.

3. Maximum Casualties by Road Type:
Determining which road types have the greatest number of injuries is essential for setting priorities for safety precautions and infrastructure upgrades.

4. Distribution of Casualties by Road Surface:
Strategies for road upkeep and enhancement can benefit greatly from the analysis of casualties based on road surface parameters.

5. Correlation between Casualties and Area/Location, Day/Night:
A spatial and temporal component was added to the data by examining correlations between casualties and variables including area/location and day/night occurrences, which aided in focused safety initiatives.



In summary, the examination of the Accident dataset has yielded significant data and facilitated well-informed decision-making about the avoidance and reduction of accidents. By utilising these insights, stakeholders may take proactive steps to improve road safety, which will ultimately result in a more secure and safe transportation environment.
